DESeq analysis with Porites notes.

1. To explore data model with the 3 levels : treat + HardCoral  
1.1 Results for contrast : treat, "T", "C" > just 1 gene DE
1.2 Results for contrasr: HardCoral, "Pd", "Pf"> 32254 genes DE btw colonies which is not a very intresting result
1.2 PCA for dds > shows that PdLd is an outlier (Why?)

2. I eliminate PdLd from the analysis and refit the same model : treat + HardCoral
2.1 Results for contrast : treat, "T", "C" > just 58 genes DE
2.2 Results for contrasr: HardCoral, "Pd", "Pf"> 37661 genes DE btw colonies which is not a very intresting result
2.2 PCA for dds > shows a difference btw colonies as well but it shows differences among the different nubbins from the same colony

3. Change model adding SoftCoralControl as a variable
3.1 Run just PCA to explore data with different models> PdLd is again an outlier

4. Changing model with SoftCoralControl without PdLd
5. Changinf model with SoftCoralControl 

I think I am not using the correct file of counts.
