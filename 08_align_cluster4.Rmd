title: "Cluster 4 Alignments"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Since the secreted proteins in cluster 4 show some evidence of coordinated expression there are two checks we would like to make;

1. Are these transcripts similar in sequence (and therefore perhaps derived from the same gene)?
2. Are these transcripts co-located on the genome?

We start by extracting the transcript cluster ids and their corresponding representative transcripts
```{r}
clusters <- read_tsv("hpc/corset/03-clusters.txt",col_names = c("contig","cluster"))

readxl::read_excel("raw_data/annotated_DEG_hm_ira.xlsx",na = "NA") %>% 
  filter(hm_cluster.x==4) %>% 
  select(cluster_id,transcript) %>% 
  write_delim(file="hpc/secreted_alignments/c4.txt")
```
