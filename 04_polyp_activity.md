Polyp Activity. Plots and Final Statistics

This is a ggplot equivalent of of the Mosaicplots used in data
exploration. This shows data aggregated across nubbins and tanks which
does hide some important variation that is hard to capture graphically
(see stats). Overall however there are two clear trends;

1.  The treated colonies are more likely to be partial or closed than
    controls
2.  Colonies seemed to be more likely to be partial or closed at the
    start of the trial and gradually converted to open as the trial
    progressed.

Based on extensive model selection analysis (see
[03\_polyp\_activity\_exploration.md](03_polyp_activity_exploration.md))
a generalised cumulative mixed effects model was chosen to fit the polyp
activity data.

Let’s consider whether there are interesting patterns of polyp activity
in relation to the PCA and Heatmap groupings. At least on the surface it
looks as though both down and up groupings (Red and Blue on the heatmap
in 02\_deseq) show more closed or partial activity early in the
experiment than those in the “neutral” group.
